The dataset was retrospectively compiled following approval from the relevant Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Ethics Committee. Data were sourced from de-identified patient biopsy records at a tertiary hospital, encompassing a defined collection window from January 1, 2023, to October 31, 2023. The dataset comprises 614 original ((361 benign and 253 malignant cases)) breast X-ray images (mammograms) sourced exclusively from a single institution: a hospital in Polokwane, Limpopo, South Africa. All images have been clinically validated to establish the ground truth by a panel of radiologists and specialized medical practitioners. The acquisition process utilized a dedicated breast X-ray system equipped with specialized accessories to minimize radiation exposure, adhering to safety protocols. All data is standardized in the PNG format with a uniform resolution of 1920 × 1080 pixels.
